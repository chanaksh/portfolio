        <p class="large">
          My name is Chanaksh Manoj Metkar. I hail from Waghale village and am a
          dedicated student striving for excellence. I completed my secondary
          education at K.B.P. Vidyalay School, Askedа, achieving an impressive
          82% in my 10th-grade examinations. Subsequently, I continued my
          academic journey at K.B.P. Junior College, Askedа, where I secured 88%
          in my 12th-grade examinations.
        </p>
        <p class="small">
          During my schooling, I maintained an average performance in
          traditional academic subjects; however, my passion for computer
          science propelled me towards a career in this dynamic field. Hence,
          upon completing my secondary education, I made a conscious decision to
          pursue computer engineering. Currently, I am enrolled in the esteemed
          PVG College, Nashik, where I am actively honing my skills and
          knowledge in this field.
        </p>

        My educational pursuits are driven by a desire to contribute
        meaningfully to the ever-evolving realm of technology. As I approach
        graduation in 2025, I continue to expand my knowledge and skills,
        immersing myself in cutting-edge technologies and participating in
        prestigious competitions. Throughout my engineering journey, I have
        undertaken several projects, including the development of a food
        delivery website and an agriculture management system.
        Additionally,broadening my expertise across various domains. Proficient
        in programming languages like C++, I have successfully solved over 200
        problems on platforms such as LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks. These hands-on
        experiences have not only strengthened my technical prowess but also
        instilled in me a problem-solving mindset essential for tackling
        real-world challenges in the realm of computer engineering.
